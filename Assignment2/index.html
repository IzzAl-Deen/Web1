            <li>Football,if you don't know what Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States, and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football; Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, arena football, or Canadian football); International rules football; rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, common origins and are known as "football codes", If you like to learn more visit this<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football" target="_blank">Website</a>, you might know it by the name soccer.</li>

            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware" target="_blank">Building Computer parts,</a>Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the central processing unit (CPU), random access memory (RAM), motherboard, computer data storage, graphics card, sound card, and computer case. It includes external devices such as a monitor, mouse, keyboard, and speakers.[1][2]
                By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is hard or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is soft because it is easy to change.
                Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.</li>

            <li>Driving,in each country there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_space_rationing" target="_blank">restrictions</a> for driving and they differ from country to another as an example, Road space rationing, also known as alternate-day travel, driving restriction and no-drive days (Spanish: restricción vehicular; Portuguese: rodízio veicular; French: circulation alternée), is a travel demand management strategy aimed to reduce the negative externalities generated by urban air pollution or peak urban travel demand in excess of available supply or road capacity, through artificially restricting demand (vehicle travel) by rationing the scarce common good road capacity, especially during the peak periods or during peak pollution events. This objective is achieved by restricting traffic access into an urban cordon area, city center (CBD), or district based upon the last digits of the license number on pre-established days and during certain periods, usually, the peak hours, this is common in latin america.</li>
